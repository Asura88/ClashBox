#### Introduction

ClashNEXT is the first proxy software for the HarmonyOS NEXT (OpenHarmony) platform based on the Navigation framework, using the modified [FlClash](https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash) kernel.

Please read the disclaimer and FAQ carefully before use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note: This repository only uploads the Hap side-loading package for the time being, and the source code is not open source for the time being.

#### Software Features

- ðŸ’»Native development: The front-end is developed using the native development language ArkTS of Hongmeng. Native development is smoother and has richer dynamic effects;
- âœ¨Cool interface: Using the native design style of HarmonyOS NEXT, adopting the UI layout design similar to [Surfboard](https://github.com/getsurfboard/surfboard), supporting dark mode, blur effect, etc., the user experience is further improved;
- ðŸ“±Full adaptation: The UI is adapted to mobile phones, tablets, folding screens, Hongmeng computers and even PuraX external screens*;
- âœ…Stable kernel: Using the highly acclaimed [FlClash](https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash) kernel, the functions are basically aligned with [FlClash](https://github.com/chen08209/FlClash), stable and reliable;
- ðŸ”„Core recovery: Due to HarmonyOS NEXT's background scheduling mechanism is not yet mature, and the software may have background processes that are closed by the system. Therefore, ClashNEXT has a built-in core recovery function. After the system kills the process, the core process will be automatically restored (this function will be automatically enabled after turning on "Background Run-Simulated Picture-in-Picture").

*PuraX external screen currently only displays apps in Huawei's whitelist, and it is temporarily unavailable before this software obtains the whitelist.

#### How to use

You can use [Auto-installer](https://github.com/likuai2010/auto-installer/) or [DevEcho Testing](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/deveco-testing/) to install.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Huawei's signature server blocks IP addresses outside mainland China. If you want to sideload software for HarmonyOS NEXT in countries/regions outside mainland China, please use a proxy or other methods to use an IP address in mainland China.

> [!NOTE]
> Apps that are sideloaded using self-signed signatures in HarmonyOS NEXT are only valid for 14 days by default. After [developer real-name authentication](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/verified/enrollment), the validity period can be increased to 180 days.
>
> Developer real-name authentication may require a Chinese resident ID card.
